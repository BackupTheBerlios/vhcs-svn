	If you want to do the same with apache2 log files for every domain in your server then you must add corresponding entry in your local logrotate configuration. For example in Debian this entry looks like the following:

filename: 
	
	/etc/logrotate.d/vhcs2

contents:

	=== cut ===
	/var/log/apache2/users/*.log {
			weekly
			missingok
			rotate 52
			compress
			delaycompress
			notifempty
			create 640 root adm
			sharedscripts
			postrotate
					if [ -f /var/run/apache2.pid ]; then
							/etc/init.d/apache2 restart > /dev/null
					fi
			endscript
	}
	=== cut ===

	To eliminate the chance for double traffic counting you must
configure your logrotate to run right after VHCS's virtual traffic
counting.
